## ⚡ Optimize Images (Lazy-load + WebP/AVIF)

This site lazily loads non-critical images and decodes them asynchronously for faster rendering and lower bandwidth.

To further reduce size, generate modern formats (WebP and AVIF) alongside existing PNG/JPG files, then use <picture> for key images.

### 1) Generate WebP/AVIF on Windows (PowerShell)

Prerequisite: ImageMagick installed and on PATH (enable “Add to PATH” during setup)
https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

Run the helper:

```powershell
pwsh -File tools/convert-images.ps1
```

This scans `images/` and `certificate/` and writes `.webp` and `.avif` next to each `.png/.jpg`.

Alternative (Node): Squoosh CLI

```powershell
npm i -g @squoosh/cli
# Example (single file):
squoosh-cli --webp auto --avif auto .\images\dp.png
```

### 2) Use modern formats with fallback

Wrap heavy images with `<picture>` so browsers pick AVIF/WebP automatically and fall back to PNG/JPG:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="images/dp.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="images/dp.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="images/dp.png" alt="Asim Husain" width="460" height="auto" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
</picture>
<!-- Keep width/height (or CSS aspect-ratio) to avoid CLS. If .avif/.webp don’t exist, PNG/JPG loads. -->
```

Tip: Prioritize `<picture>` for the largest images (profile, project cards, certificates). Icons can stay as PNG/SVG.

### 3) Keep layout stable

- Prefer fixed width/height or CSS `aspect-ratio` to reduce layout shifts
- Use `decoding="async"` and `loading="lazy"` on non-critical images (already added)
